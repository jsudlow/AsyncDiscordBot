This bot runs in the background. In the example it polls a database every 5 seconds. In this way you can develop your own advanced functions to do many other cool things.
In this example the bot monitors a restock table in the database. The attributes are things like the title, the url and the image of the item. These get sent to the 
channel the bot is logged into - so all members of the discord can see that an item has restocked. Other monitor bots push this information into the database so it acts
like a broad cast hub.
